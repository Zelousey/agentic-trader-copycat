"""
Zelos Cloud Functions - leaderboard-agentictrading project.

Runs inside the leaderboard-agentictrading Firebase project, so both functions
below can read/write that project's Firestore using the project's own built-in
permissions - no downloaded service-account key needed anywhere.

publish_alert    - a scheduled Claude task calls this over plain HTTPS with a
                    shared secret to publish a generic Zelos alert.
gumroad_ping     - Gumroad calls this itself (its account-wide "Ping" webhook,
                    configured once in Gumroad's own Settings > Advanced) on
                    every sale, so a buyer's ownedSkills gets set automatically
                    instead of relying on them to self-report a purchase.

Both endpoints check a shared secret before doing anything, so if either URL
ever leaked, it could only trigger that one narrow action - never read or
write anything else in the database, and never touch Gumroad or Robinhood
directly.
